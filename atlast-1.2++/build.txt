Build.sh guide
======== =====

build.sh is a simple way of switching between configurations.

So, on a 64 bit linux system:

build.sh -h

gives

building for x86_64
       OS is Linux

Help.
        -a <makefile args>
        -d              Dry run.
        -h              Help.
        -o <variant>    Build a variant based on an architecture
        -p <profile>    Use the profile to set defines, and libraries.
        -x <makefile arch>
        -l              List available profiles

Profile is ./basic.mk

Runing this:

./build.sh clean

Now does a 'clean' allowing ./build.sh to be substitude for make in tools 
such as eclipse.

-a passes arguments to make, e.g.

./build.sh -a clean
./build.sh -a atlast

-d Shows what make would do/

-p Selects a profile.  Each profile is in a file with a .mk extension by default
an empty file name basic.mk is pointed to by profile.mk.  To create a new profile add your options into a file of your choice (e.g. fred.mk) and then:

./build.sh -l

building for x86_64
       OS is Linux

List of Profiles

basic
fred

Current profile is: basic

To switch to your new profile do:

./build.sh -p fred

This will clean the existing build, remake the link and build the application.

-o and -x are for cross compiling.
