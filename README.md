ATLast
======

This is a fortk of a fork.

It is a fork of Michael Henderson's (aka quoha) of Atlast.

I want to add a few features and use as the basis for a scriptable unit test framework.

Below is Michael's original README.

=================

This is a fork of John Walker's ATLAST FORTH embeddable interpreter. My goal is to change the code to use a single
struct to hold the state of the interpreter. I think that will make it easier to embed. The cost will be speed. Going
through the struct will prevent many optimizations that were performed against the global variables. For my purposes,
this is an acceptable tradeoff.

You can find Mr. Walker's original work at https://www.fourmilab.ch/atlast/atlast.html. It has also been added to
other repositories here on GitHub. Searching for "atlast" will take you to them.
